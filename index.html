                users?</strong
              >

              <strong>Account</strong> - in Recovery Connect, your bailiff
              account is treated as its own company/independent contractor. This
              means that you need to accept or decline new cases, addresses,
              holds/closes, and more. It also means that once you add your data
              to a file such as photos, you need to transfer them to Napier
              Bailiffs as they are treated as a separate company. If you do not,
              the office will not be able to view them or proceed with client
              communications.

              <strong>Where can I find my files/cases?</strong>
              - You can find your cases via the 3 buttons at the very top of the
              screen, hovering over the cases dropdown in the blue ribbon at the
              top of the screen, or by searching for a piece of related data
              within the search bar in the blue ribbon and clicking on the
              desired file/case. In the Mobile app, you can find them by
              searching for them, or by checking your to-do list.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Where can I find the case documents/attachments?</strong>
              - You can find your cases documents by first finding the case,
              then looking for the attachments tab on the case. To view or
              download an attachment, just click on the little gear icon next to
              the desired attachment and either hit "view" or "download".

              >
              - You can create case updates either in the mobile app or web app
              by first finding the case. Once in the file, you can click on the
              updates section, then find the "+" button and create your update.
              After the update is written, save it as a public update.

              <strong>How do I upload non recovery related photos?</strong>
              - You can upload photos not related to the recovery by first
              finding the case, then selecting the attachments/photos tab on it.

              symbol and adding them. Then click on the gear icon next to them
              and follow the prompts to share the photos with the client/Napier
              Bailiffs.

            <li>
              <strong>How do I complete a recovery in Recovery Connect?</strong>
              - You can complete a recovery in Recovery Connect either using the
              web application or the dedicated mobile application. In both, you
              will first need to find the file, then "on-hook" the collateral.
              Once "on-hooked", the file will be ready to have a recovery
              completed, on which you can access on the file itself in the web
              app, or on your to-do list in the mobile app. From there, follow
              all of the prompts involved in the recover process until you see
              it removed from your to-do list. The office will then acknowledge
              your recovery.
